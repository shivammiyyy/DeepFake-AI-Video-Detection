Deepfake Face Detection using Neural Network
This project implements a neural network to detect deepfake videos by analyzing faces extracted from video frames. It includes data preprocessing, face extraction from videos, and training a deep learning model to classify real and fake videos.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deepfake-face-detection.git
cd deepfake-face-detection
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your Google Colab environment (if using Colab):

Change the runtime type to GPU: Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU.
Download and unzip the dataset from Google Drive:

python
Copy code
from google_drive_downloader import GoogleDriveDownloader as gdd
gdd.download_file_from_google_drive(file_id='<your-file-id>', dest_path='./data.zip', unzip=True)
Usage
Preprocessing
To preprocess videos and extract frames:

Change the paths accordingly in preprocess.py.

Run the script to get the average frame count of the videos:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py
Extract frames from videos and process the faces:

bash
Copy code
python preprocess.py  # Ensure your paths are correct for videos and output directories
Training
Use the model_and_train.py script to train your model:

Ensure the dataset is properly organized and preprocessed.
Train the model using the provided training script:
bash
Copy code
python model_and_train.py
Sample Dataset Link
Please replace <your-file-id> in preprocess.py with the actual file ID from Google Drive. Example:

ruby
Copy code
https://drive.google.com/file/d/your-file-id/view?usp=sharing

Data
The dataset used for this project contains real and fake videos from the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC). Please download the dataset and place it in the data directory.

Preprocessing
The preprocessing pipeline performs the following steps:

Downloads and unzips the dataset.
Extracts frames from videos and filters out videos with fewer than 150 frames.
Detects faces in the frames using face_recognition and saves them in the desired format.
Training
The training script builds and trains a deep neural network model using the processed dataset. It includes the following components:

Frame extraction from videos.
Face detection and alignment.
Training a neural network for deepfake detection.
Results
After training, the model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the validation set. Further details about the performance and metrics will be provided in the future.
